# OpenPonk-Kendrick modularity

This is a prototype tool based on [OpenPonk](https://openponk.github.io/), modified and extended in a way that handles modular models with live feedback of results. It is created on [Pharo](http://pharo.org/) smalltalk platform.

For now, it supports a small subset of [Kendrick](https://ummisco.github.io/kendrick/) functionality, but is extendable for various kinds of models.
